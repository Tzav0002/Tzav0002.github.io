                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Matthew Tzavelas. I am 21 years old and I was born here in Ottawa, Ontario. <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> is my second post secondary experience. My first course was the Algonquin Music Industry Arts program which I graduated from in December of 2020. It was an excellent program and I learned everything from music theory, to buisness, digital synthesis and music psychology.

                    As you can probably tell by the program that I graduated form, I really enjoy music. Listening to music is enjoyable, but <em>most</em> of all I love making music as well by using <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr> software. I am constantly learning and trying to get better at making music. Hopefully one day I will achieve a professional sound.
